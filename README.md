# Reflection

I wanted to build a site that was a bit different and a bit fun and made use of how easy it is to create mutiple pages becuase of the template system that SSGs have. So I decided to create a Choose your own adventure site, as these are very simple pages but there are a LOT of them. I really enjoyed the process and the fun of building something a little bit different. I created a story purely for this purpose.

## Design
I knew I would only need three layouts for the site, a 'home' page, a 'choice' page and a 'end' page. I drew up a hierarchy chart to create a flow for the game, so I knew exactly how many pages to build and which other pages they would link to.
The hierachry can be seen below:

## Creating the templates
I created all three templets with tester pages first. Making sure that each template was responsive.

## Creating the pages
Once the templates had been created it was only a matter of creating the hierachy using them. This was done with a whole bunch of markdown files. The links were added to the page seperately using the info from the file.

## Final Touches
Having set up all the pages and linked them up, it was time to run through the site in full. While I found it to be a bit clunky sometimes, all in all it worked quite well.

## 'Make it Live' attempt
After building out the site with npm, I used the Siteground account I have from last year to put the site online. it can be found at [clairemcauliffe.com](clairemcauliffe.com) (hopefully). All in all it was a fun little project to complete, not entirely without it's faults, but I am pleased with the way it turned out.
