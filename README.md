# Reflection

I wanted to build a site that was a bit different and a bit fun and made use of how easy it is to create mutiple pages becuase of the template system that SSGs have. So I decided to create a Choose your own adventure site, as these are very simple pages but there are a LOT of them. 

## Design
I knew I would only need three layouts for the site, a 'home' page, a 'choice' page and a 'end' page. I drew up a hierarchy chart to create a flow for the game, so I knew exactly how many pages to build and which other pages they would link to.
The hierachry can be seen below:

# Creating the templates
I created all three templets with tester pages first.
